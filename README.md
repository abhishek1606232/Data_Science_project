Brain Tumor Segmentation Using Deep Learning
This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of deep learning-based models for automated brain tumor segmentation on MRI scans. Three architectures—U-Net, ResUNet, and DeepLabV3+—were trained and compared in terms of accuracy, Dice score, Intersection over Union (IoU), and training time. The framework demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing studies, balancing high segmentation precision with computational efficiency.
